# Linting and Resource Management Resolution

## Overview
Successfully resolved 73 linting errors from `task pre_format` command and eliminated ResourceWarnings from database connection leaks in test suite.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Linting Errors (73 total)
- **F811 - Redefined imports**: Removed duplicate `TraumaCreate` import in `src/api.py`
- **E501 - Line too long**: Fixed long f-string formatting in `src/api.py` and datetime field definitions in `src/models/models.py`
- **PLR6301 - Method could be static**: Converted all test methods in `tests/test_trauma.py` to static methods
- **PLR2004 - Magic value used**: Replaced HTTP status code magic numbers (404, 500) with `HTTPStatus` constants
- **W293 - Blank line with whitespace**: Cleaned up whitespace in all affected files

### 2. ResourceWarnings - Database Connection Leaks
- Identified unclosed SQLAlchemy database engines in test fixtures
- Implemented proper engine disposal pattern using `engine.dispose()` in pytest fixtures
- Separated engine and session fixtures for cleaner resource management

## Key Files Modified

### src/api.py
- Removed duplicate import: `TraumaCreate`
- Fixed long f-string line formatting for better readability
- All trauma-related endpoints remain fully functional

### src/models/models.py
- Reformatted long datetime field definitions across multiple models
- Maintained all foreign key relationships and constraints
- No functional changes to database models

### tests/test_trauma.py (Complete Rewrite)
- **Static Methods**: Converted all test methods to static for better organization
- **Constants**: Added `HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND` and `HTTPStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` constants
- **Resource Management**: Implemented proper database engine disposal pattern
- **Fixtures**: Separated `engine` and `session` fixtures with proper cleanup
- **Coverage**: Maintained comprehensive test coverage (23 tests)

## Resource Management Pattern
```python
@pytest.fixture
def engine():
    """Create test database engine with proper disposal."""
    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
    yield engine
    engine.dispose()  # Critical for preventing resource leaks

@pytest.fixture
def session(engine):
    """Create test database session."""
    with Session(engine) as session:
        yield session
```

## Validation Results
- **Linting**: All 73 errors resolved ✓
- **Tests**: 70/70 tests passing ✓
- **Coverage**: 82% overall coverage maintained ✓
- **Resource Warnings**: Eliminated from trauma test suite ✓
- **Code Quality**: `task pre_format` passes cleanly ✓

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Static Test Methods**: Improved test organization and performance
2. **HTTP Status Constants**: Better code readability and maintainability
3. **Proper Resource Cleanup**: Prevents database connection leaks
4. **Separated Concerns**: Engine and session fixtures handled independently
5. **Comprehensive Validation**: All functionality preserved while improving code quality

## Dependencies
- `http` module for `HTTPStatus` constants
- `pytest` fixtures with proper resource disposal
- `SQLAlchemy` engine management best practices
- `ruff` linting tool compliance
